# Symbolic Regression through Genetic Programming

Final Project for the 2024/2025 Computational Intelligence course @PoliTO.
The goal is performing symbolic regression using GP.  

Contributors: Leonardo Sgroi s331398 , Fabio Gigante s328890, Dragos-Constantin Buhnila s331394.  

Some of the notebooks search for the dataset in a /data folder in the root of the project. So to use
them make sure to create the folder and insert the dataset in which you want to perform 
symbolic regression.
